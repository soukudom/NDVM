# NDVM (Network Dataset Evaluation Metrics)
The Network Dataset Evaluation report is a tool used to analyze datasets to estimate trustworthiness. The provided solution can describe basic parameters such as the number of classes, imbalance ratio, and duplicated samples. Moreover, the report can provide PCA visualization and metrics for dataset optimization with a trustworthiness estimate. The implementation is available as a Jupyter notebook for direct visualization and providing a self-explanatory example. There is also a python module for proper deployment.
